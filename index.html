    <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>As a team, we commit to the Scrum values of commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect to promote collaboration, accountability, and steady progress. Our goal is to deliver a high-quality, functional product while strengthening our technical skills and teamwork in a supportive environment.</p>
    <h3>Team Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Commitment: Team members must reliably stick to deadlines</li>
        <li>Courage: Proposing ideas and asking for help/clarification on essentially anything are strongly encouraged to promote a strong work ethic and everyone on the team being aligned on the same page</li>
        <li>Focus: During class time and meeting times, members are expected to stay on task and complete work efficiently.</li>
        <li>Openness: Clear communication is expected of each member. If anything happens that would prevent them from being able to complete their assigned tasks, they should reach out in a timely manner and plan with the others to figure out how to work around the interruption.</li>
        <li>Respect: Members should maintain respectful behavior amongst other members.</li>
    </ul>
